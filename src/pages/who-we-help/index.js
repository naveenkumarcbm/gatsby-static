                        Have you ever wondered what it would be like to solve real business problems like exceptions and chargebacks, late shipments &amp; payments, PO changes, custom EDI reporting, and
                        unacknowledged documents without having to rely on your IT team? What if you could access the EDI documents yourself and interact with them in an easily readable format? Just think
                        how much faster you could get your job done. Well, wonder no more!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        What if you had the ability to focus your time on other pressing business issues and tasks without having to worry about daily and hourly EDI requests? What if you had a solution
                        that enabled anyone at your firm to act upon critical business data to solve real problems without the need for your time and expertise? Your task list just got a lot shorter.
